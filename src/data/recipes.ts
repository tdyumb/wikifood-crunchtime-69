    servings: 18,
    ingredients: [
      '1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, spoon and leveled',
      '1/2 teaspoon baking soda',
      '1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt',
      '10 tablespoons unsalted butter',
      '3/4 packed brown sugar',
      '1/2 cup white sugar',
      '1 large egg',
      '1 large egg yolk',
      '2 teaspoons vanilla extract',
      '1/2 teaspoon espresso powder, optional',
      '1 3/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips'
    ],
    instructions: [
      'Preheat the oven to 325°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.',
      'Melt the butter in a pan, then take it off the heat once it turns light brown and gives off a nutty aroma. Set it aside while you get the rest of the ingredients ready.',
      'In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Then set the bowl aside.',
      'In a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, white sugar, whole egg, egg yolk, vanilla, and the melted butter. If using, whisk in the espresso powder as well.',
      'Gradually add the dry ingredients to the large bowl in three parts, gently stirring after each addition until fully mixed in. Fold in most of the chocolate chips, saving a handful to press on top of each cookie before baking.',
      'Scoop about 1 1/2 tablespoons of cookie dough and roll into balls, or use a medium cookie scoop. Place them on the baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches of space between each one so they have room to spread.',
      'Gently press a few extra chocolate pieces into the top of each cookie dough ball before baking.',
      'Bake the cookies for 12 to 16 minutes. About halfway through, turn the baking sheet around. They\'re ready when the edges look golden but the centers still appear a bit soft.',
      'Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then move them to a wire rack to cool completely.',
      'Add any toppings or icing you like, then serve and enjoy!'
